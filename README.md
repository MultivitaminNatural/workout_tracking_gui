# workout_tracking_gui
the goal was to create a gui using tkinter to help me track my progress from session to session and practice python at the same time
takes in exercise, sets, reps, date, weight, variation(mainly for calisthenics purposes but it has place in weightlifting as well), rpe, rest time. 
validates the input data
		// todo:might wanna change  weight to float since it can be decimal as well... 
  sets, reps, rpe etc have to be integers, date has to be in yyyy-mm-dd format, rpe has to be in range 1-10, exercises have to from the dictionary
  created a dictionary of the exercises i want to be eligible to be entered
		//todo: create add exercise button? its not strictly necessary though
 used tkinter to build the gui
 	set the size
	centered it
	added all the input rows
	added exit, submit, add header buttons
